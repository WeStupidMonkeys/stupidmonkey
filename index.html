<p>Imperfect. Fallible. Irrational. Emotional. Wasteful. But most of all, just plain stupid.</p>

<p>Who am I talking about? Well, you obviously... But also me, and all other people around us. We're not the smart, confident, knowledgeable people we pretend to be - we're all just stupid monkeys living in a world constructed by other stupid monkeys.</p>

<p>The worst part? We don't even think that it's true, we don't acknowledge our shortcomings or the shortcomings of our species in general.</p>

<p>But in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king - and in the world of stupid monkeys, the monkey who realizes his own ignorance is maybe not king, but at least an informed stupid monkey.</p>

<h2>What makes us monkeys stupid?</h2>

<p>First, we have no idea what's going on or how the universe works. We're living on a rock flying through space. Everything we do is based on assumptions and habits, coded into our genetic profile through thousands of years of evolution. We're machines made for survival, not for understanding and discovering meaning. (Hint: there is no meaning.)</p>

<p>Second, we mindlessly spend the precious little time we have on this planet pursuing things that - in hindsight - will be pointless. The 9-to-5, social media, watching TV, complaining about this-or-that political party or social outrage. What's the point? Is this truly what thousands of years of evolution has developed us for? To live in a mindless blur of existence?</p>

<p>Third, if there's one thing that's clear from history is that we are generally wrong - about almost everything. New religions replace old religions, new ideologies replace old ideologies, new priorities replace old priorities. The only constant is change and the fact we keep changing.</p>

<p>Finally, we're not just wrong about the things and institutions we build, we're also wrong about ourselves. Our ape brain steers us through a fog of emotions and hidden motives - things that we are not consciously aware of.</p>

<p><b>Remember: You're just a stupid monkey following your stupid monkey brain.</b></p>
